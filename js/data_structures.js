// DIRECTIONS FOR REFERENCING
// add code that will use your two arrays to create an object.
// The keys of your object should be horse names, and the values should be colors.
// Your solution should be something that would work for any number of colors/horses,
// as long as the two arrays are the same length

// Create a container that will have horses names as keys and colors as values
