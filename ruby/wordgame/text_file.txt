pseudocode a class for a word-guessing game
Assume your driver code will handle input and output
as far as the user is concerned. In other words, write a class
designed for a computer program to use,
not one designed for a human to use directly,
then use driver code to bridge the gap between human and Ruby object.

One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that),
and another user attempts to guess the word.

Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the
length of the word.

Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word.
So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something
like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _",
which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win,
and a taunting message if they lose.

####Pseudocode
# word-guessing game class
# Input: User enters a word
# Output: Underscores representing how many letters are in the word

# Input: A different user guesses a letter in the word
# Output: If the letter is in the word it will replace the underscore

# Input: Guesses are limited and equal to how many letters are in the word
# Output: A congratulatory message if they win or a taunting message if they lose
